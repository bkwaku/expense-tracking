# README

We are building a small application from scratch to keep track of our expenses; each record will consist of a date, a title and an amount. A record will be treated as Credit if its amount is greater than zero, otherwise it will be treated as Debit.

## Summarizing, the application will behave as follows:
* When the user creates a new record through the horizontal form, it will be appended to the records table
* The user will be able to inline-edit any existing record
* Clicking on any Delete button will remove the associated record from the table
* Adding, editing or removing an existing record will update the amount boxes at the top of the page
